# Advent of code 2024 in C 

This repository contains my C code solutions for Advent of Code 2024. I chose to write these in C as a way to refresh my skills and get back up to speed with the language after a hiatus. The primary purpose of this project is educational, serving as a personal tutorial to relearn and practice C programming. Please note that this code is intended solely for learning purposes and is not optimized for use in actual Advent of Code solutions.

To run these solutions, navigate to the directory corresponding to each Advent of Code day (e.g., aoc1, aoc2, etc.), and execute the command `make run`. This will build and run the binary using clang. If clang is not installed on your system, please install it before attempting to run the solutions.
